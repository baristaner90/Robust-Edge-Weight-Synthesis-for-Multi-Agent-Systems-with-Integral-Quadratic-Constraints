# Robust-Edge-Weight-Synthesis-for-Multi-Agent-Systems-with-Integral-Quadratic-Constraints
This work implements a non-linear programming method to synthesize edge weights of an adjacency matrix for a multi-agent system using bilinear matrix inequalities, which suffer uncertainties. First, convex concave decompositions are used on the bilinear matrix inequality constraints for nominal $H_{\infty}$ synthesis. Then this method is improved to consider uncertainties using integral quadratic constraint framework. Agents composing the multi-agent system are represented as linear time-invariant single input single output systems, which share their output information to achieve consensus. Topology of the multi-agent system is predefined and edge weights are defined as functions of a variable.
